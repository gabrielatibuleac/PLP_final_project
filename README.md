# PLP_final_project
Project
Details:
Design and implement an interpreter for a custom programming language
Implementation language: your choice (e.g., Python, Java, C++, OCaml, Haskell, Rust)
Deliverables:
Language specification document (containing syntax, semantics, type system, and a brief report explaining design decisions)
Working interpreter with test suite
User documentation with code examples
Evaluation criteria:
Language design (15p): expressiveness, coherence, novel features
Implementation quality (15p): correctness, code organization, error handling
Documentation (10p): clarity of specification and examples
Complexity (10p): advanced features (type inference, higher-order functions, etc.)
Recommended language features to consider, but can be different:
Core: variables, arithmetic/logical expressions, control flow (if/while)
Intermediate: functions, recursion, data structures (lists, records)
Advanced: closures, type checking, pattern matching, modules
